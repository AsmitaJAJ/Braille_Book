# Braille_Book
Our project aims to have a software which takes books/texts inputed in a database and translate it to braille, which can then later be printed on 
a physical tablet.
This project aims to ease text to braille translations so that visually impaired people can access books and texts more easily.
Right now, though we are ill equipped with the hardware required we are working on the software part of it.
To run the project on your system right now just requires a python interpreter installed on the system.
